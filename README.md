## (2) Our Interests
The primary interest of this group lies in understanding the extent to which innovation can be driven by financial investment.
Globally, innovation across various fields is a vital factor in determining a nation's prosperity. This trend is expected to continue and will have a significant impact on national strength in the future.

How to foster innovation remains a challenging question both at the national and corporate levels. One major source of innovation is research conducted at universities and private companies. However, such research requires funding. To promote innovation at the national level, in addition to mobilizing private sector investment, government subsidies are considered an effective approach.

On the other hand, a key challenge lies in measuring the extent to which innovation is actually occurring. One potential indicator is the number of patents filed when new technologies or services are developed. This can serve as a proxy for gauging innovation activity.

## (3) Research Question
The analysis aims to investigate the relationship between research and development investment and the number of patents filed in different industrial sectors in Japan.

## (4) Hypothesis
There is a positive correlation between the amount of R&D spending and the number of patents obtained across industries.
